Updated personal website / app using SSR with [`nextjs`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/)

![Preview](public/images/preview-web.png)

### Front-end stack

#### React
I like making Single Page Application
#### Nextjs
I like having the benefit of multiple page website but combined with single page application
#### Chakra-ui
I like this component library most of the default styles are good, but I can still modify and customize it easily and dynamically
#### Urql
I was previously using Apollo Client for GraphQL client but it was too beefy and have things I dont want, so I am trying URQL and it has been awesome

### Pages
> 1. Home page | Showing my name, social links
> 2. Repos page | Showing all my Github Public Repostories
> 3. About page | Showing my crappy bio that I didn't put any effort
> 4. Chill page | Currently semi-working I need to squash some bugs

### Tech Stackfor the entire thing (at least the thing I want to use)
> 1. React
> 2. Typescript
> 3. Go
> 4. Postgres
> 5. GraphQL

```ts
const app = (): void => {
    console.log(`Thanks for checking this out, ${you}!`);
};
```
